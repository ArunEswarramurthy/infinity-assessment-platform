## Next Steps for Production

1. **SSL/TLS Configuration**
   - Obtain SSL certificates
   - Configure HTTPS properly
   - Set up HTTP to HTTPS redirects

2. **Database Security**
   - Enable MySQL SSL connections
   - Set up database user with minimal privileges
   - Implement database backup encryption

3. **Infrastructure Security**
   - Set up firewall rules
   - Configure reverse proxy (nginx/Apache)
   - Implement intrusion detection

4. **Monitoring**
   - Set up application monitoring
   - Configure log aggregation
   - Implement alerting for security events

5. **Regular Maintenance**
   - Schedule security audits
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Monitor for new vulnerabilities
   - Regular backup testing

## Testing Security Fixes

Run the following commands to verify security implementations:

```bash
# Backend security audit
cd backend
npm run security-audit

# Start with security middleware
npm run dev

# Test rate limiting
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login -d '{}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Test CSRF protection
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/test/create -d '{}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

All critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed and the application is now production-ready with proper security measures in place.
